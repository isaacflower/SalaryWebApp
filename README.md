# Take-home Salary Calculator

This basic web app built in Python and Django calculates the amount of take-home pay one might expect for a given salary, taxes, bills and expenses.

Code for the User and Calculator classes can be found in `CalculatorApp/calculator.py`.

Instances of these classes are created in `CalculatorApp/views.py` and fed user inputs, the results of which are visualised in a table and Sankey diagram (Plotly).

The app is currently hosted at: https://salarywebapp.onrender.com/ 

Data from user inputs is not stored anywhere.
